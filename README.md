# üöÄ Quantifying Reusability: An End-to-End Data Science Analysis of Falcon 9 Landings

This project develops a comprehensive **full-stack data science pipeline** to analyze and predict the success of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket's first-stage landing.  
The central motivation is the **~$100 million savings** achieved through booster reuse, making accurate prediction critical for launch cost determination and competitive strategy.

## I. Project Scope & Business Context

The objective is to create a machine learning model to predict the binary outcome (**class**) of a Falcon 9 landing given various launch parameters.

- **Business Problem:**  
  If we can determine whether the first stage will land (with **83.33% accuracy**), we can accurately estimate launch costs ‚Äî essential for competitive bidding.

- **Methodologies Used:**  
  This project spans the entire data science lifecycle:
  - **Data Sourcing:** API Calls & Web Scraping  
  - **Analytics:** Python, SQL, and Geospatial (Folium) EDA  
  - **Dashboarding:** Plotly Dash  
  - **Machine Learning:** Hyperparameter-tuned Classification Models

## II. Technical Pipeline Summary

### 1. Data Acquisition and Wrangling

- **Data Sourcing:**  
  Combined data retrieved programmatically via the **SpaceX REST API** with supplementary details obtained through **web scraping** for a complete mission history.

- **Data Processing:**  
  Cleaned and unified the dataset, defined the target variable (**class**), and applied **One-Hot Encoding** to categorical features (*Launch Site*, *Orbit*).  
  Numerical features (*Payload Mass*, *Flight Number*) were standardized using **StandardScaler**.

### 2. Advanced Analytics and Visualization

- **Interactive Dashboard (Plotly Dash):**  
  Built a dynamic dashboard featuring a **Launch Site Dropdown** and **Payload Range Slider** for real-time analysis.

- **Geospatial Analysis (Folium):**  
  Confirmed that launch sites are strategically positioned ‚Äî maintaining approximately **65 km distance from cities** (safety) while staying close to **coastlines** and **railways** (logistics).

- **Key Findings:**  
  Visual analysis identified a clear **learning curve** (increasing success rate over time) and confirmed the **3,000‚Äì6,000 kg** range as the optimal payload window.

### 3. Machine Learning Prediction

- **Model Performance:**  
  Three top models achieved identical and robust test accuracy:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**  
  All yielded **83.33% accuracy**.

- **Risk Assessment:**  
  The shared **confusion matrix** revealed the primary weakness as **False Positives** ‚Äî incorrectly predicting success ‚Äî the highest-risk error for recovery decisions.
